This project contains a simple multi-client server and client implementation for a math expression calculator. The server can handle multiple clients and solve their math expressions. The client will generate random math expressions and send them to the server for evaluation. The server keeps a log of client connections and disconnections with their respective durations.

Running: (running with two clients and one server per say)
Note: You can create as many instances of a client by running in 2.another terminal window.

1. Ensure Python3 installed
2.Open 3 terminals
3.Change directory of two terminals to Client Directory and one in 2.Server Directory.
4.Run server: python3 server.py
5.CMD to run both clients: python3 client.py
6.Observe
7.Kill Server after clients are done: CTRL+C
